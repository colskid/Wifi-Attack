Welcome to the **WIFI Attack** project! This repository contains resources and examples for capturing a WiFi password using multiple tools including  `wifite` , `aircrack-ng` , & `Hashcat` within the Kali Linux environment.

## Introduction

In this project, I delve into the wireless attack tools available in Kali Linux with the aim of capturing my neighbor's WiFi password. **WITH HIS EXPLICIT CONSENT**, I sought to achieve this objective and, subsequently, enhance the security of his network based on the findings.

## Wifite
To get started with the project, I needed to start `wifite` in the terminal.

```sh
sudo wifite --kill
```
- --kill: This command will attempt to stop any ongoing wireless attacks initiated by wifite. Keep in mind that the 
          effectiveness of the --kill option can depend on various factors, and in some cases, it might not instantly 
          terminate all processes.

Wifite automates various stages of a wireless network attack, particularly focusing on Wi-Fi networks. The stages of a Wifite attack typically include:

- **Scanning**: Wifite scans the surrounding area for available Wi-Fi networks. It identifies SSIDs, encryption types, signal strengths, and other relevant information.
- **Target Selection**: The user selects the target Wi-Fi network for the attack. Wifite can target specific networks based on the user's input or automatically select the best target based on predefined criteria.
- **Attack Initialization**: Wifite initializes the selected attack based on the chosen options. This may include WEP attacks, WPA/WPA2 dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, PMKID attacks, or attacks against WPS vulnerabilities.
- **Dictionary Attack (WPA/WPA2)**: If the target network uses WPA or WPA2 encryption, Wifite may perform a dictionary attack. It tries to crack the pre-shared key by systematically testing passwords from a specified wordlist.
- **Bruteforce Attack**: Wifite may conduct a brute-force attack by systematically trying all possible password combinations until the correct one is found. This is often a last resort and can be time-consuming.
- **WEP Attacks**: If the target network uses WEP encryption (which is outdated and insecure), Wifite may perform attacks specific to WEP.It attempts to crack the WEP key using various methods.
- **PMKID Attack (WPA/WPA2)**: Wifite can use the PMKID attack method to crack WPA/WPA2 pre-shared keys without capturing a full handshake.This is a faster method compared to traditional handshake-based attacks.
- **WPS Attacks**: Wifite may conduct attacks against the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) feature, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the network.
- **Successful Authentication**: If the attack is successful, Wifite informs the user and provides the key or password that was cracked.

While `wifite` couldn't crack the password, we successfully captured a `.pcap` file that will prove useful moving forward.

## Aircrack-ng

To use a dictionary attack with another wordlist, I used this format in `aircrack-ng`:
```sh
sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt /home/kali/Desktop/mikewifi.cap
```

- -w: specifies the path to a wordlist file
- `/home/kali/Desktop/mikewifi.cap`: This is the path to the capture file (mikewifi.cap) that contains the encrypted Wi-Fi data you want to analyze. <br>

Despite attempting to crack the password using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist and several others, I was unsuccessful. After trying over 15 million passwords, I was unable to gain access to the network. 

## Social-Engineering

Lets start off with the definition.<br> <br>
*What is social engineering?* <br>
Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information, performing actions, or making decisions that they wouldn't typically do. <br><br>

**The following day:** I happened to run into my neighbor and recounted my endeavor of attempting over 15 million password combinations to access his WiFi without success. He chuckled at the sheer magnitude of the attempts and casually mentioned that he believed he was still using the default password provided by his internet service provider (ISP). This casual conversation sparked my curiosity. I began pondering whether ISPs follow a specific method in crafting default passwords. Has anyone delved into this inquiry before? The moment had arrived to embark on a journey of exploration and research.


## Research

After conducting an extensive research dive, a discernible pattern emerged in this ISPs default passwords: a straightforward structure consisting of (first word)(second word)(three-digit number). Delving further into this revelation, I stumbled upon an article revealing that someone had already compiled a list adhering to this format. The list was ingeniously generated by appending adjectives and nouns followed by three digits. However, there was a caveat â€“ the file size amounted to a hefty 90 gigabytes, a space requirement beyond the capacity of my Linux machine.

Undeterred, the creator had also crafted a more manageable wordlist, containing just the words without the digits. This pared-down file offered a significantly reduced size that was usable on my machine. The upcoming section will unravel whether we can successfully crack the password using `hashcat`.


## Hashcat
The first thing I had to do was convert the mikewifi.cap to mike.hc22000 using a tool:

```sh
sudo hcxpcapngtool -o mike.hc22000 mikewifi.cap 
```

*The command hcxpcapngtool in the terminal is employed to convert a captured WiFi traffic file, represented in the PCAP-NG format as mikewifi.cap, into the HCCAPX format. The resulting file, named mike.hc22000, is formatted to store critical information related to WiFi handshakes. The HCCAPX format is commonly utilized in tools like Hashcat, particularly for offline password cracking attacks against WiFi handshakes. This conversion process is integral to preparing the captured data for subsequent security analyses and experiments within the project.*
